## **Executive Summary**
This project analyzes UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transaction data to understand how digital payments have grown over time.  
The main goal is to practice **basic data analyst skills** using a real FinTech dataset.

Python was used to clean the data, MySQL was used for SQL analysis, and PowerBI was used to create a simple dashboard.  
The dashboard shows key trends, growth, adoption by banks, and seasonal patterns in UPI transactions.

## **Why I Built This Project**
UPI is one of the most widely used digital payment systems. Millions of people use it every day.

I built this project to learn and show:
- How UPI transactions grow over time  
- How people use UPI (small or large payments)  
- How many banks are part of the UPI system  
- Whether some months have higher transactions  

This is similar to real work done by a data analyst.

---

## **Business Context**
Banks and fintech companies need to understand how digital payments are growing.  
Raw data is hard to understand, so analysis is needed.

This project helps convert raw UPI data into **clear numbers, trends, and charts** that are easy to read.

---

## **Problem Statement**
Analyze UPI transaction data to:
- Check growth in transactions  
- Understand usage behavior  
- Track bank adoption  
- Identify seasonal patterns  

Then present the results in a simple dashboard.

---

## **Dataset Overview**
- **Source**: Public UPI transaction dataset (kaggle) 
- **Data type**: Monthly aggregated data  
- **Main columns**:
  - Transaction volume  
  - Transaction value  
  - Average transaction value  
  - Number of banks live on UPI  

This dataset does not contain user-level data.

---

## **Tools Used**
- **Python** – Data cleaning  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data handling  
- **MySQL** – SQL analysis  
- **SQLAlchemy** – Python to MySQL connection  
- **PowerBI** – Dashboard creation  

---

## **Data Preparation**
Using Python, I:
- Loaded the dataset  
- Converted the month column to date format  
- Sorted data by time  
- Renamed columns for easy understanding  
- Handled missing values  

The cleaned data was then loaded into MySQL.

---

## **Analysis Approach**
Steps followed in this project:
1. Clean data using Python  
2. Load cleaned data into MySQL  
3. Use SQL to calculate KPIs and trends  
4. Analyze growth, adoption, and seasonality  
5. Create a one-page PowerBI dashboard  

---

## **Key KPIs Tracked**
- Total UPI Transaction Volume  
- Total UPI Transaction Value  
- Average Transaction Value  
- Latest Month Transaction Volume  
- Number of Banks Live on UPI  

---

## **Key Insights**
- UPI transaction volume has increased over time  
- Average transaction value is mostly stable  
- More banks are joining UPI every year  
- Some months have higher transaction activity  

---

## **Business Impact**
- Helps understand how fast UPI is growing  
- Helps in planning system capacity  
- Shows adoption of UPI by banks  
- Makes data easy to understand for business teams  

---

## **Dashboard Overview**
The PowerBI dashboard shows:
- Key KPIs  
- Transaction trends  
- Bank adoption trends  
- Seasonal patterns  

The dashboard is simple and easy to understand.

---

## **Final Takeaway**
UPI has grown strongly over time.  
This project shows how data analysis can turn raw payment data into useful insights.

---

## **What This Project Shows**
- Data cleaning using Python  
- SQL analysis using MySQL  
- KPI calculation  
- Dashboard creation using PowerBI
